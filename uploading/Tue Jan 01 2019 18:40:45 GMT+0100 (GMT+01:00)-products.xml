                <title>Darkest Dungeon Steam Key GLOBAL</title>
                <g:description>Darkest Dungeons by Red Hook Studios is a role-playing video game with RTS/TBS elements mixed in, also one you have never experienced before. It&amp;rsquo;s dark, twisted, interesting and emotionally overwhelming to say the least. You inherit an estate under which lies portals to other dimensions with grievous monsters finding their way out and corrupting the lands. As the current owner of the estate and the surrounding grounds, you must recruit various adventurers, send them to explore these portals and extinguish the evils within. Praise the Brave Adventurers Darkest Dungeons offer you fifteen different character classes to recruit. Each class hero has unique skills, statistics and aspirations, that in time can be upgraded. Adventurers can level up and equip better items. Unfortunately, if an adventurer dies, there&amp;rsquo;s no way to bring him/her back to life.  Teams of adventurers explore dungeons in real-time, side-scrolling manner. Once combat starts, the action takes place in a turn-based approach, where turn by turn the tides of battle are decided. The decisions you take before and during combat are extremely important. Things like order in which your team is running through the dungeon can single-handedly decide battles. Since you can only send your adventurers in groups of four, their traits, skills and overall compatibility are of utmost importance to consider. Dungeons are Terrifying The key factor that makes Darkest Dungeons exceptional and overwhelming is the stress, which eventually can and will affect each adventurer daring to enter the dungeon.  Either sustainable or rising stress level can result in certain afflictions like arachnophobia or Satan-phobia. These afflictions impact your heroes in various ways, both in and out of combat. If stress is left unmanaged and the adventurer is repeatedly sent into the darkest dungeons, sudden heart-attack becomes one of the threats to consider. To fight the psychological and physical terrors met in the dungeon, your task, using the gold gathered through expeditions, is to build various infrastructures to help heal bodily and mental conditions of the adventurers.</g:description>

                <title>Dragon Ball FighterZ Steam Key GLOBAL</title>
                <g:description>It is no surprise that pairing up one of the best fighting game developers in the world in Arc System Networks with likely the most recognizable anime series in the world, Dragon Ball, has resulted in an absolutely fantastic fighting game &amp;ndash; Dragon Ball FighterZ. The game showcases the beauty in simplicity as all commands are very easy to learn and the same four basic buttons are used to pull off every move on every character, without need of super-difficult combinations that a lot of other fighting games are fond of. Therefore, anyone with a Dragon Ball FighterZ key is pretty much sure to get the maximum level of satisfaction and explore all of the games&amp;rsquo; possibilities, no matter how experienced or skilled they are. In the game you will find a plethora of well-known characters to play as, from the main protagonists of the series such as Goku or Krillin, to the villains that instilled fear into the marrow of your bones when you had your eyes on the TV screen as a child, such as Frieza, Cell, or Buu. The Arcade mode for Dragon Ball FighterZ challenges the players to improve, as every match is measured by grades, the higher grade you get, the higher up in the match column you go, fighting against more challenging opponents in your next fight.

These are men brave enough to stand alongside you in the face of terror. Their skills and attributes can be upgraded, also you can weaponize and armour them up as you see fitting.Different merchants can also join your quest, providing some insight on certain materials that you&amp;rsquo;ll come across or even craft and alter unique items exceptionally for you. Improved Mechanics, Combat and ControlsRe-specialize and experiment with your build, as new skills and armour choices now stimulate the ever-changing approach to what is best for your character. A variety of defensive abilities, potions with a cooldown timer, and newly added health globes ensures that tactical decisions and correct pathing now are more relevant than ever before.In Diablo3, the classic Diablo II hot-bar has been altered to include customizable shortcuts and mouse buttons to make your combat feel as fast and smooth as you always wanted. Choose Your HeroDiablo3 offers seven different character classes: Witch Doctor, Barbarian, Wizard, Monk, Demon Hunter, Crusader and Necromancer.

                <title>Insurgency Steam Key GLOBAL</title>
                <g:description>Insurgency is a tactical first-person shooter developed by New World Interactive. The game is a standalone follow-up to the well-known and highly praised source mod. Set in Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria the game is ultra-realistic when it comes to battles. Sound, visuals, your positioning and even your weight is of utmost importance as every mistake made can be lethal. Insurgency has nine multiplayer and five Co-Op modes, variety of maps, and an offline play available on all maps and modes with surprisingly fierce AI bots. All the Good Stuff&amp;bull; Over 40 different weapons that are customizable to an extent where you can create a decent long-range rifle out of M16A4 by boosting its optics and adding weight to the barrel.&amp;bull; 16 maps with either day or night setting, from clashes in the ruined Middle Eastern Villages to vastly open hills and forests, or the narrow streets of Baghdad.&amp;bull; 9 Multiplayer and 5 Co-Op modes That can be played either online or offline. The in-game AI bots are significantly intelligent and at times very punishing.&amp;bull; Squad system with different character classes and roles to fill in the required position.&amp;bull; A realistic and immersive first-person perspective with a simplified HUD that shows no health bar, mini-map or your ammo.&amp;bull; Fully customizable gear and weapons that accordingly affect your weight, stamina and movement speed. Realism at its Finest If you want to experience what a real gun-down feels like &amp;mdash; Insurgency is the game for you. It could only get more real if you were holding a gun yourself. The in-game focus to realism is immense, from the HUD where you don&amp;rsquo;t see your health bar, the mini-map or how much ammo you still have, to FX audio of gunfire and cracking, squishing sound that the boots make, to strategies where team-play is vital. Things like a single shot to the head being lethal is also worth noting.</g:description>

                <g:description>Rocket League developed by Psyonix, is a futuristic Sports-Action game that has forever changed the traditional approach to digital football.

Futuristic rocket cars controlled from third-person perspective are the new superstars in the field! Some Awesome Features  • In Rocket League you customize your vehicle to meet your standards, with over 10 billion possible combinations to choose from! • There&amp;rsquo;s a single-player Season Mode solely for you to explore and experience. • Various in-game modes such as: The Snow Day Hockey, Dropshot and many others! • Thrilling and action-packed 8-player online mode, with interchangeable teams and many other configurations. • Local or online split screen mode, that hosts 2-,3-, and 4- players! • Competitive cross-platform ranked ladders where only the best can climb to the top. • Amazing Rocket League replays with rewind and fast-forward features, with the broadcast action is spectate-able from anywhere in the arena.  Chaotic Monster Jam or Golden Layer of Strategy? While at first glance charging your vehicle into an oversized ball can seem very simple and casual, in fact Rocket League key offers quite complex mechanical depths with relative in-game physics to consider. Various aerial manoeuvres, timing-specific somersaults, ball passes to teammates and other rocket engine powered attacks needs to be sent in a precise angle and takes a lot of practise to master. Rocket league is as fun and casual as it is competitive and challenging, in both cases it&amp;rsquo;s a real blast!</g:description>

                <title>Sniper Elite 4 Steam Key EUROPE</title>
                <g:description>Sniper Elite 4 developed by Rebellion Developments is a tactical third-person shooter with stealth elements. It&amp;rsquo;s the forth sequel to Sniper Elite franchise. The game is set in year 1943, the action follows up the events in Sniper Elite III. This time the Royal Navy finds out about rumours of a new Nazi weapon being built in Italy, and they send you to interfere with the Nazi plans. The campaign consists of eight missions. The maps are large, and the game follows &quot;play it how you want to play it&quot; philosophy, thus there&amp;rsquo;s no voice in your head governing you to objectives. It&amp;rsquo;s Not All About Sniping Sniper Elite 4 without a doubt excels at the way you scope your enemies. If you want to land some successful hits for the infamous X-RAY cam system to activate, many factors are to be considered. Gravity, muzzle&amp;rsquo;s velocity, wind speed and direction, scope drift and ammo scarcity are to name a few. While sniping is one of the key elements, you have variety of other means to eliminate your AI Nazi enemies. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s silent take-downs with a knife, planting bombs on already cold Nazi bodies, or setting wired traps it&amp;rsquo;s all up to your ingenuity and imagination.  Sniper Elite 4 sure has stealth elements incorporated, where you can spot, stalk and silently eliminate unsuspecting soldiers, however, if you are spotted and enemies from all over start rushing to your location, good old-fashioned gun-down using SMG is also up your sleeve. Not So Lonely The game offers quite a few options to share the experience with a friend. You can Co-Op and run through all the single-player campaign alongside your friend, where both of you can cause havoc in whatever form you desire! Survival Co-Op mode launches packs of enemies straight at you in the form of twelve increasingly more difficult waves. There&amp;rsquo;s much more action in this mode, but there&amp;rsquo;s still plenty freedom to experiment and improvise. Considering multiplayer, sniper vs sniper battles are as intense as they are patient, composed and enduring. One of the signature multiplayer modes in Sniper Elite 4, requires players to land the longest distance kill shot to win.  Control multiplayer mode is basically a standard variant of capture and hold. However, having a sniper makes it fast and focused simultaneously.</g:description>

                <title>The Sims 4 Origin Key GLOBAL</title>
                <g:description>Sims 4 is the fourth sequel to one of the most favourite and beloved real-time, real-life simulations. Create your own customized character, build a house, find a job &amp;mdash; make a career, surround yourself with loving family and neighbours, involve in daily activities or do whatever else you can think of, it&amp;rsquo;s Sims 4 after all. Stretch, Bend and Drag customization techniques One of the key characteristics as to why the Sims series have always been so fun, is their character creation menu and Sims 4 is no exception. The new Create-a-Sim tool allows you to basically become a sculptor and bend your Sim in almost any physical form and shape: you can click, drag and manually tweak almost every aspect of your creation. House customization options are as vast as it gets or at least as vast as Create-a-Sim tool. Not only can you customize every corner of your household, but you can also pick from an already premade components or even better: download a pre-made blueprint from an online storage, where players from all over the globe put their ideas into practice. Raise or lower the very foundations of your house or stretch and drag the edges of your walls if you lack some space. Do Sims feel something?They do now! And they feel not just something, in Sims 4, they feel a lot. Traits and aspirations are back, while being fun and useful, this isn&amp;rsquo;t about them. The latest edition presents a pack of emotions that now are the key factors in control whenever you do not interfere. There are many triggers to put your Sim in a certain emotional state, and these will have wide-range implications over the course of your game. Sims are developing in more than one way! Last but not least, multitasking. No longer will your Sims awkwardly drink coffee and only after the cup is empty will start communing. You will feel this much desired mechanic right of the bat, and it makes the overall gameplay much smoother and coherent.</g:description>

                <title>The Walking Dead Steam Key GLOBAL</title>
                <g:description>The Walking Dead is a graphical adventure game, played from third-person perspective, developed by Telltale and based on The Walking Dead comic book series. Walking Dead game also blew some fresh and desired winds to an adventure genre and inspired many similar games to be developed. The game consists of five episodes. What You Decide is What You Get In The Walking Dead game, you are playing as Lee Everett, a convicted murderer on his way to the correctional facility. The outbreak of zombie apocalypse has already started, and thanks to the occasion, Lee manages to escape. He soon finds a girl named Clementine and his new goal now is to survive and protect Clementine at any cost. Precisely the plot is what makes this game so special and grand. And it&amp;rsquo;s not just another kind of adventure game that you would expect, going through every single dialogue line, while possible, is certainly not what The Walking Dead is all about. Throughout the story Mr. Everett must make many important decisions and choices, whether it&amp;rsquo;s to select which of the characters in the story must die or shout out your mind to someone when you could remain constraint. In other words, all players are tasked with the same goal of protecting Clementine, but what means are taken to achieve it is entirely up to you. To make the Walking Dead story flow coherently, most of the decisions are timed, thus must be made in the blink of an eye. Once you reach Episode 5, the things that you have and haven&amp;rsquo;t done throughout the story are sure to come up. The Walking Dead game does pack scenes of intense action and the game often catches you when you least expect it. In the end though, the game is not about running and gunning. It&amp;rsquo;s the story that navigates the action. Immersing into an experience, developing deep bonds between characters, and making difficult choices to complete the story are the key elements.</g:description>

                <title>Wolfenstein: The Old Blood Steam Key GLOBAL</title>
                <g:description>Wolfenstein: The Old Blood developed by MachineGames is an action-adventure first-person shooter. It is also a prequel to Wolfenstein: The New Order. The Old Blood is set in an alternate history, year 1946, where Germans are on the brink of winning the WWII. The game consists of two overarching acts &quot;Rudi Jager and the Den of Wolves&quot; and &quot;The Dark Secrets of Helga von Schabbs&quot;, which are divided in eight chapters. The single-player story features war veteran William &quot;B.J.&quot; Blazkowicz, who is tasked to discover the location of a hidden Nazi compound. What to Expect? You can definitely expect to shoot some Nazis. The Nazi soldiers, as you probably have guessed, are depicted as torture-loving fanatics. Amongst common soldiers, however, you will also come across either regular, or mechanical dogs, robotic super-soldiers, regular civilians and some more sinister Nazi creations.  Throughout your assignment you&amp;rsquo;ll find a bunch of modern German weapons to put into good use. Due to unlimited space in weapon inventory, every single weapon you find is yours for the taking, whether it&amp;rsquo;s a bolt-action rifle, a grenade launching Kampfpistole or a metal pipe, which can either be used to smash some brain or open some weak environmental surfaces.  Perks system allows you to boost character stats like more health, more ammo, more armour and many other. You can obtain these perks by completing certain side-missions and tasks. Perks give you significant advantage over your foes and prove to be especially useful when facing stronger enemies.  Wolfenstein: The Old Blood also offers some interesting mechanics with stealth take-downs, wall climbing abilities, and dual-wielding always being at your service. The way your gameplay goes, depends solely on your ingenuity and preferred game-style.</g:description>

                <title>Warhammer: Vermintide 2 Steam Key GLOBAL</title>
                <g:description>Warhammer: Verminitide 2, developed by Fatshark is a serious mixture of hack and slash, first person co-op and RPG elements. The game is set in the fictional Warhammer universe where evil forces have befallen the middle earth. Chaos and terror ravage the lands and it&amp;rsquo;s up to you and your team of heroes to wipe out the newly formed alliance between amped up Norsemen, Humanoid rats and many of their supporters. With the cleansing power of axes, two-handed swords, hammers and various other unique weapons you stare evil straight in the eye. If you ever hear someone say that only the game is included in the Warhammer: Vermintide 2 price, do not let them fool you! What the people are paying for isn&amp;rsquo;t the game. It&amp;rsquo;s an amazing story told through a role-playing hack and slash experience and the best part about it is that you are the creator of your own story. Thus, grab that Warhammer: Vermitide 2 key that you&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about and begin an epic adventure of friends, enemies, emotions, and battle! Heroes That You NeedIf you have played the five Heroes of Ubersreik in the previous edition, you are already familiar with their battle might. If not, well Warhammer: Verminitide 2, brings them back in action.&amp;nbsp;Each Character has their own special abilities, passive bonuses, unlockable skill trees and range of potential weapons. When you level the character to a certain point, two more career paths open &amp;mdash; completely changing the feel to your hero. There&amp;rsquo;s more, you can further customize your character by allocating points to different skill trees which grant buffs, modify your abilities or improve stats. Warhammer: Verminitide 2 offers vast variety of different weapons, each of which is useful and unique. From heavy hammers and two-hand swords, to knives or arrow shooting assault rifles, every weapon is balanced, has attack arc, and reach. Whatever you decide to wield is in a sense a matter of preference as few swings are enough to understand what a certain weapon is all about. The Enemy ApproachExplore over a dozen downright gorgeous locations, which while being bright and colourful go surprisingly well with all the blood, gore, doom and gloom that Warhammer is known for.Throughout the Warhammer levels you will meet various monsters such as vengeance seeking Ratmen or close to insanity standing Norsemen. These are accompanied by Elite monsters like Hook Rat, Assassin or Leech, and of course, Bosses!&amp;nbsp;Do not be fooled by the simple hack-and-slash controls. Packs of enemies from all sides, elites with special moves and other challenges that you face, can get frighteningly difficult at times and requires quite an extraordinary team-work to go well.</g:description>

                <title>Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 Battle.net Key EUROPE</title>
                <g:description>Activisions and Treyarchs new born military shooter sequel Call of Duty: Black Ops 4, branches off into the market with a bang. The latest entry in the long-running sub-series of shooters set in an alternate and mysterious realm, this time enrolls players in a near-future setting, focusing on competitive multiplayer mode more than ever before. The Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 price is fitting for a game of its quality and whatever the price you get your Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 key at, you can be assured that it will be worth it with all the different game modes you can play in. It is the first time throughout the series, when there is no traditional single-player campaign mode. Such change was made because Call of Duty was always meant to be a multiplayer game, with its&#039; focus being on competitiveness, continuity and replay-ability, as opposed to single experience narrative-heavy campaign. Solo experience, however, will still be present with bot companions in Zombies mode and single player challenges, through which you will be able to try out 10 Specialist characters. You will be using plenty of these in multiplayer mode so might as well know their background stories too. Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 multiplayer joins the latest craze in Battle Royale mode and brings Blackout. Blackout is a map larger than any other seen in the franchise, it&#039;s an all out immersive battle for up to 100 players, containing vehicles to control land, air and water. Standard multiplayer will contain already familiar modes such as: hardpoint, domination and objective control. In which you will be able to pick from one of the Specialist characters with various futuristic weapons and special abilities. Total control over how you customize your character to fit your preferred game-style, thrilling grounded combat experience, precise tactical decisions and character choosing to strive victorious, is now more important than ever before. And on top of that, Zombies mode returns in Call of Duty: Black Ops 4! The newest zombies arch has three unique and thrilling stories to offer immersive and action-packed experience. Mayhem and obliteration while annihilating the rotting undead, who could ask for more?</g:description>

                <title>Fallout 76 Bethesda.net Key EUROPE</title>
                <g:description>Bethesda Games Studios releases Fallout 76, one more post-apocalyptic expansive open-world journey for you to experience, one entirely different from its predecessors though. Fallout 76 is set in the earliest post-explosive timeline throughout the series. Your starting grounds are one of the earliest bunkers to be opened: Vault 76, a bunker that opens little more than 20 years after the bombs dropped.&amp;nbsp;This means that the setting you are enrolled in, is affected by the aftermath of nuclear devastation, but is merely touched by time. Brighter color scheme, less muddy and dull environment and buildings that are yet to crumble are waiting to be explored. Do not cheer too much, as your favorite apocalyptic dwellers like ghouls and death-claws along with all new monsters unique to the game undoubtedly lurks in the dark.First time in the series, the Fallout 76 key unlocks an entirely multiplayer game, which brings a lot of interesting changes:1. Good ol&#039; V.A.T.S. slow motion feature is no more present, and instead you are now able to pick and target body parts of your enemies.&amp;nbsp;2. S.P.E.C.I.A.L. character creation process with skill points and perks is back, interesting change is that perks are no longer permanent and can be interchanged or toggled on/off at your command.3. C.A.M.P. or Construction and Assembly Mobile Platform is entering the game, which in short lets you construct your base whenever you are online and turn your base into a blueprint whenever you log off. So offline base-raiding is not an option here.4. Crafting is also back, and as Fallout 76 is entirely online focused, every single item/material or recipe is up for a trade!5. Hunger and thirst concerns, while not as detrimental as in some other games, will still make you monitor your character thoroughly. Various debuffs will occur otherwise.If you are worried that Bethesdas&#039; take on multiplayer will dim the PVE side of the game, worry no more, as a solid story mode and various missions are a part of the Fallout 76 price that you pay to get the game. You will also have an option to switch between PVP and PVE mode whenever you feel like it.</g:description>

                <title>Battlefield 1 Origin Key GLOBAL</title>
                <g:description>EA&amp;rsquo;s Battlefield 1 turns back the clock and brings us into the very first massive global conflict of the modern era - WW1. It&amp;rsquo;s the fifth game in the series, but the very earliest in the time frame where the action is occurring. Massive multiplayer mode that Battlefield is widely known for, incredible constantly changing environments, various air and ground vehicles and weapons used at that time are recreated within the game&amp;rsquo;s setting. There&amp;rsquo;s more, Battlefield 1 also has a well-written single-player story mode, which features 5 in-depth stories from the era. Ever-changing battlefield It&amp;rsquo;s up to you to decide where to start your fight as an all-out world war revolves around cities, mountains and deserts. The environments are immersive and vast, with bombs exploding and bullets flying everywhere. All that surrounds you can be destroyed at any given time, which means there isn&amp;rsquo;t a single corner where you can feel outright safe. Do Bring a Horse to a Tank Fight Amongst the already familiar tanks and planes that we are all accustomed to, you&amp;rsquo;ll also be able to operate an armoured train, gigantic airships, revolutionary warship &amp;ndash; Dreadnought, and last but not least a horse. Following historical accuracy, Battlefield 1 has riders striding in battle on a horseback, as WW1 marked the last conflict, during which horses had any relevant use. The speed and manoeuvrability provided by a horse is not a matter of laughter though. News to Multiplayer With a multiplayer fitting for up to 64 players Battlefield 1 once again packs the battleground with intense explosions, never-ending action and havoc. Together with the standard all-out multiplayer gun-down, an all-new Operations mode is here. In this multiplayer mode players are placed in two teams, one tries to push the frontline onto the next map, while the other fights to prevent this from happening.</g:description>

Characters can be switched out normally, or during certain combos. Street Fighter X Tekken story revolves around an unknown cubical in Antarctica. The object is called Pandora as it gives additional powers to close by beings in conflict. There&amp;rsquo;s a whole story to it and some specific team set-ups have their unique story elements added.</g:description>

                <title>Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2 Steam Key GLOBAL</title>
                <g:description>Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2 is a multi-platform tactical shooter with a single focus on realistic sniper experience. The game was developed by City Interactive. Control U.S. Marine Captain Cole Anderson as your in-game character and prepare to dish out some hand-to-hand as well as long-distance assassinations. With a whole new CryENGINE3, Sniper: Ghost Warrior 3 offers insanely realistic and detailed urban environments as well as rich and dense jungle areas. With the new engine, the in-game AI was completely re-shaped and now you can expect pretty much anything from the enemy. The game excels at stealth mechanics and extremely realistic sniping. If you want to execute lethal shots, from let&amp;rsquo;s say a thousand meters, you will have to monitor your breathing, wind speed, gravity, bullet-drop and even the sound of your gun firing. When talking about your gear, a list of sniper rifles, that accurately replicate their real-life counterparts, is provided for you to experiment with. Unfortunate for the enemy, you&amp;rsquo;ll also have binoculars as well as night and thermal vision to be the ultimate predator during the night.</g:description>

                <title>Frostpunk Steam Key GLOBAL</title>
                <g:description>Frostpunk is a city management survival RTS game developed by 11 bit studios! It&amp;lsquo;s the year 1886, after the erruption of a few super vulcanoes, sun dimming down and other factors that are yet unknown, a never before seen winter has come to freeze everything what&amp;lsquo;s still left of humanity.  In response to the ever-falling temperatures British authorities establish generators &amp;mdash; massive coal-driven towers that are meant to secure the survival of mankind. The game offers four scenarios in which you must make challenging and often ruthless decisions to survive the freeze.  Gather and manage resources such as metal, wood, coal and food, command your workers and engineers to build various facilities, manage political campaign and consider or ignore the demands of your people. Your every action can and most likely will cause a reaction from your inhabitants, you&amp;lsquo;ll be constantly evaluated and either judged or praised upon. Your goal is to survive and this game will do everything in its power to make you tremble and fail.</g:description>

                <g:description>Homefront: The Revolution is an FPS game set in an alternate near-future timeline, where North Korean soldiers have invaded the streets of Philadelphia! The game was developed by Dambuster studios but is not the continuation to the original Homefront story. You control Ethan Brady, a recruit to the Resistance group aiming to deplete the invaders. In an open-world setting separated by three vast regions &amp;mdash; green, yellow and red zones, you will fight many furious battles in a guerrilla type combat. In other words, create as many diversions and short gunfights throughout the territory to split enemy forces as they are superior to you in both, quantity and fire-power. Rise to power from a simple recruit to revolutionary leader in the wide campaign that this game has to offer. Recruit other revolutionaries, establish safehouses, create and modify weapons to meet your needs in every situation and be the one in the centre of the war for Independence!</g:description>

                <g:description>There&#039;s no better feeling than successfully landing your 7-button-combination skill in your foe&#039;s face or is there?! Iron Galaxy Studios presents Divekick! It&#039;s an action fighting game that will make you question the meaning of life itself! Control one of many ravaging fighters and execute TWO BUTTON sequences with precision, skill, and timing. Yes, you&#039;ve read it correctly, this game presents completely different approach to fighting!

There are no cheaters here, no super skills, power ups, knock downs, and ground control. This Indie masterpiece mocks fighting games&#039; genre in a very pleasing fashion, humour leads every character and every back story, and the fights are very entertaining and evenly matched! At the end of the day, Divekick is what it is, and not what it isn&#039;t. It&#039;s a great fun for fighting game enthusiasts as well as for casual players not very keen on the genre.</g:description>

                <title>Shadow of the Tomb Raider Steam Key GLOBAL</title>
                <g:description>Shadow of the Tomb Raider is an action-adventure game developed by Eidos Montr&amp;eacute;al in collaboration with Crystal Dynamics. The action follows the events from Rise of the Tomb Raider, where Lara Croft now must stop the Mayan apocalypse that she has previously unleashed. Travel to Amazon, traverse the Peruvian jungle and find the legendary lost city of Paititi. The game is to conclude her journey! Will Lara Croft be able to stop the foretold apocalypse? Will she finally become one with the Tomb Raider as she&amp;rsquo;s supposed to? What dangers lurk ahead? These and other questions will be answered in Shadow of the Tomb Raider. Setting Shadow of the Tomb Raider offers the largest map in the franchise yet. Vast jungle environments, deadly dungeon systems filled with tricking puzzles and underwater setting will leave you literally speechless, not to mention the long forgotten realm of the past, far from the reach of any sort of civilization, technology, and modern-human interaction! The Legendary Lost City  Shadow of the Tomb Raider price is a bargain on its own, as you&amp;rsquo;ll discover the lost city of Paititi, there you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to trade resources, salvage various parts, and acquire an arsenal of weapons. Many side quests and missions will also provide you with plenty information about the city and its history. Controls The main controls don&amp;rsquo;t differ much from the previous game; however, significant changes have been made to underwater behaviour, and stealth mechanics. Lara is now able to hold her breath underwater for much longer periods, with the introduction of air pockets. Also, in the new Shadow of the Tomb Raider game, she can now hide from her enemies once she escapes their line of sight, jump of a cliff using a rope, cover herself in mud, and hide in bushes or behind walls! Use jungle to your advantage because stealth is one of the major Shadow of the Tomb Raider key elements.</g:description>

To kill a zombie, you will have to either shoot it in the head or put so much lead into it that it simply doesn&#039;t have a way to move. To carry all of this out, you will need the wide variety of tools the game provides you.</g:description>

                <title>Call of Duty: World War II Steam Key EUROPE</title>
                <g:description>The Call of Duty franchise goes back to its roots with Call of Duty WW2. For years Activision has been releasing games focusing on the wars of the future or present day, yet it has been more than a decade since the last classic World War 2 release. Due to it not being the newest game in the series anymore, the Call of Duty WW2 price has dwindled, which is great news for any gamer fan as the game is not even 2 years old as of now, which is nowhere near &amp;lsquo;old&amp;rsquo;. Therefore, unlocking a Call of Duty WW2 key is sure to still give you endless hours of up-to-date entertainment. The game introduces three major game modes: the single-player campaign, the multiplayer mode, and the Zombies mode, where this time the fight is against Nazi Zombies. As usual with Call of Duty games, the campaign offers a deep, emotional story, where every character matters, they are easy to get attached to, and keeps the players on the edge of their chairs for the whole duration. The Zombies and the Multiplayer modes in Call of Duty WW2 both offer endless action with loads of deaths, fast respawning, guns ablaze while competing against other players or working together with your team in a bid to take down the Nazi Zombies, which requires a lot of communication.</g:description>

                <g:description>If you&#039;re tired of ripping through countless opponents and leaving chaos and destruction in your wake with a bunch of fiery explosions or a hail of bullets, Aragami may just be the game for you. Instead of guns and explosives, you will creep around and use shadows to your advantage. You will be able to teleport to shadows, turn yourself invisible and even summon a shadow dragon to infiltrate enemy ranks and take care of the enemies. While the result is likely to be a trail of bodies no matter the method, this game encourages you to make sure that nobody even knows you were there.</g:description>

                <g:description>Sims 4 is the fourth sequel to one of the most favourite and beloved real-time, real-life simulations. Create your own customized character, build a house, find a job &amp;mdash; make a career, surround yourself with loving family and neighbours, involve in daily activities or do whatever else you can think of, it&amp;rsquo;s Sims 4 after all. Stretch, Bend and Drag customization techniques One of the key characteristics as to why the Sims series have always been so fun, is their character creation menu and Sims 4 is no exception. The new Create-a-Sim tool allows you to basically become a sculptor and bend your Sim in almost any physical form and shape: you can click, drag and manually tweak almost every aspect of your creation. House customization options are as vast as it gets or at least as vast as Create-a-Sim tool. Not only can you customize every corner of your household, but you can also pick from an already premade components or even better: download a pre-made blueprint from an online storage, where players from all over the globe put their ideas into practice. Raise or lower the very foundations of your house or stretch and drag the edges of your walls if you lack some space. Do Sims feel something?They do now! And they feel not just something, in Sims 4, they feel a lot. Traits and aspirations are back, while being fun and useful, this isn&amp;rsquo;t about them. The latest edition presents a pack of emotions that now are the key factors in control whenever you do not interfere. There are many triggers to put your Sim in a certain emotional state, and these will have wide-range implications over the course of your game. Sims are developing in more than one way! Last but not least, multitasking. No longer will your Sims awkwardly drink coffee and only after the cup is empty will start communing. You will feel this much desired mechanic right of the bat, and it makes the overall gameplay much smoother and coherent. This edition includes Life of the Party Digital Content</g:description>

Your job is to travel to various locations and eliminate contracted targets.

There are plenty of places to hide and there is an ability to disguise as another person. The weapon of murder could be basically anything, ranging from a poisoned soup to a sniper rifle. Use that to your advantage. Plan out your own perfect strategy. Don&#039;t be afraid to experiment and unleash your creativity. You are the world&#039;s ultimate assassin, so the way you dispose of your targets is up to you. You need to do anything it takes to complete the mission. Due to frequently depicted violence and gore, Hitman is more suited for mature players. Hitman - The Full Experience includes all released episodes.</g:description>

                <g:description>Have you ever wanted to be in the shoes of a professional racer? If so, Race Driver: GRID is just the game for you.

As soon as you get enough capital, you can invest it in your own cars and choose whether you want to drive for the teams or drive independently. GRID features three main regions: United States, Europe and Japan. Each of them has their own championship. There are also several types of events to compete in, like GT Championships, drifting, touge, open wheel racing and demolition derby. Real world road courses, like Le Mans and Spa Francorhcamps are also included in the game. Should you happen to fail while taking that sharp turn, GRID also introduces a limited-use flashback function, which rewinds time up to 10 seconds when used.</g:description>

                <title>Resident Evil 7 - Biohazard (Gold Edition) Steam Key EMEA</title>
                <g:description>Includes base game + season pass. Resident Evil 7-Biohazard marks the series return to its roots of survival horror. The game is less action-oriented and more emphasis is put on exploration. The main protagonist of the game is Ethan Winters, an American civilian looking for his wife. Differently from the previous entries in the series, the protagonist barely has any combat experience. However, he is still able to arm himself with various weapons like handguns, shotguns, explosives and chainsaws. Resident Evil 7-Biohazard is the first game in the main series to use first-person point of view and the first full-length game to use RE engine as well. There is also another huge difference from the previous entries in the series. Ethan&#039;s enemies can only be temporarily incapacitated and encounters with them can be avoided by running away or being stealthy. Resident Evil 7-Biohazard is sure to deliver heart-pounding survival horror experience that is unmatched by any other franchise.</g:description>

It provides the players with mostly the same story elements and vastly improved graphics, audio and control schemes. The game is set in the outskirts of Racoon City. There were some bizzare murders going on and a special forces team was sent to investigate. During the investigation they were attacked by zombified dogs and retreated to the mansion nearby. The mansion didn&#039;t turn out to be as safe as it looked. It was full of horrible secrets that weren&#039;t meant to be discovered. It is up to you to lead the team through a maze-like mansion where death awaits in every corner. Select one of the team members and fight for your life. Many dangerous creatures and difficult puzzles lay ahead so be prepared to do anything it takes to survive.</g:description>

If you happen to find a planet with amazing environments, wild-life, or scenery, take some photos as you might be the only single individual to have seen it, and for the time-being &amp;mdash; perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s the last. Choose your playstyle, be a merciless pirate and steal from the poor, or become a huntsman and live off bounties, then there&amp;rsquo;s a trader path: reap resources from rich planets and sell them for only the heavens know what worth. Or just fly doing your business and explore the unknown, that is, be the brave explorer who must unravel the mysteries of our very existence! As the universe itself is a living and breathing organism, it is everchanging and expanding constantly, and you must constantly change along with it. Share your discoveries with other players, and who knows, they&amp;rsquo;ll share theirs! Exploration was always captivating, with No Man&amp;rsquo;s Sky it&amp;rsquo;s simply breath-taking!</g:description>

                <title>Battlefield 5 (Xbox One) Xbox Live Key GLOBAL</title>
                <g:description>The military FPS juggernaut is back. EA Games storms the market with their fifth addition to Battlefields&amp;rsquo; franchise. Battlefield V is set back in one of the most intense and horrific events of the past that switched the axis of power around the globe, the Second World War. Improved handling, vast customization options, all-new multiplayer experiences, a variety of unique war stories created for single-player, all new co-op content along with stunning graphics and visual effects make this action-packed shooter more immersive than it has ever been. Get lost in action: From an all-out 64-player death-match to attack and defend skirmishes, from team versus team clash to last man standing battle royal, Battlefield V multiplayer has it all. If you are a less competitive type or just want to get the feel of how hard the times were, solo-campaign offers a variety of historical close ups, where you can play for one of the protagonists fighting in unique locations, varying from steaming desserts to icy mountain passages. Then there is a Co-op mode with the opportunity for up to 4 players to form a squad, customize your characters and face never before seen challenges together. The overall feel: As expected from Battlefield series, the graphics and overall mechanics are smooth and precise. Extension to movements and character animations provide the ability to execute rolls, vault, climb, slide, glide, run while crouching, jump, fall and other essential survival movements. You can also pick from 4 different soldier class types and 5 archetypes, drive various military vehicles, fortify your defence stations as well as gain access to many more in-game content.</g:description>

                <title>Shadow of the Tomb Raider (Xbox One) Xbox Live Key GLOBAL</title>
                <g:description>Shadow of the Tomb Raider(Xbox One) is an action-adventure game developed by Eidos Montr&amp;eacute;al in collaboration with Crystal Dynamics. The action follows the events from Rise of the Tomb Raider, where Lara Croft now must stop the Mayan apocalypse that she previously unleashed. Travel to Amazon, traverse the Peruvian jungle and find the legendary lost city of Paititi. The game is designated to conclude her journey. Will Lara Croft be able to stop the foretold apocalypse? Will she finally become one with the Tomb Raider as she&amp;rsquo;s supposed to? What dangers lurk in the jungle? These and other questions will be answered in Shadow of the Tomb Raider. &amp;nbsp; Setting &amp;nbsp; Shadow of the Tomb Raider offers the largest map in a franchise yet. Vast jungle environments, deadly dungeon systems filled with tricking puzzles and underwater setting will leave you speechless. &amp;nbsp; The Legendary Lost City &amp;nbsp; Discover the lost city of Paititi, there you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to trade resources, salvage various parts, and acquire weapons. Many side quests and missions will also provide you with more information about the city and its history.  Controls &amp;nbsp; The main controls don&amp;rsquo;t differ much from the previous game; however, significant changes have been made to underwater behaviour, and stealth mechanics. Lara is now able to hold her breath underwater for much longer periods, with the introduction of air pockets. Also, she can now hide from her enemies once she escapes their line of sight. Jump of a cliff using a rope, cover yourself in mud, hide in bushes or behind walls! Use jungle to your advantage because stealth is the key. &amp;nbsp; Preferences &amp;nbsp; Each aspect to the game has its own difficulty setting, so you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to choose your exploration, puzzle and combat settings based on your preference. Immerse in the world of Tomb Raider for one final journey that will unravel it all!</g:description>

                <title>Battlefield 5 Deluxe Edition (Xbox One) Xbox Live Key GLOBAL</title>
                <g:description>The military FPS juggernaut is back. EA Games storms the market with their fifth addition to Battlefields&amp;rsquo; franchise. Battlefield 5 is set back in one of the most intense and horrific events of the past that switched the axis of power around the globe, the Second World War. Improved handling, vast customization options, all-new multiplayer experiences, a variety of unique war stories created for single-player, all new co-op content along with stunning graphics and visual effects make this action-packed shooter more immersive than it has ever been. As expected from a major EA release, the Battlefield 5 price comes in at AAA pricing but you can be assured that you will get every penny&amp;rsquo;s worth out of the amazing game. Get your Battlefield V key today and jumps straight in the non-stop action. Get lost in action:From an all-out 64-player death-match to attack and defend skirmishes, from team versus team clash to last man standing battle royal, Battlefield 5 multiplayer has it all. If you are a less competitive type or just want to get the feel of how hard the times were, solo-campaign offers a variety of historical close ups, where you can play for one of the protagonists fighting in unique locations, varying from steaming desserts to icy mountain passages. Then there is a Co-op mode with the opportunity for up to 4 players to form a squad, customize your characters and face never before seen challenges together. The overall feel:As expected from Battlefield series, the graphics and overall mechanics are smooth and precise. Extension to movements and character animations provide the ability to execute rolls, vault, climb, slide, glide, run while crouching, jump, fall and other essential survival movements. You can also pick from 4 different soldier class types and 5 archetypes, drive various military vehicles, fortify your defence stations as well as gain access to many more in-game content.</g:description>

                <title>Sniper Elite 4 (Deluxe Edition) Steam Key GLOBAL</title>
                <g:description>Sniper Elite 4 developed by Rebellion Developments is a tactical third-person shooter with stealth elements. It&amp;rsquo;s the forth sequel to Sniper Elite franchise. The game is set in year 1943, the action follows up the events in Sniper Elite III. This time the Royal Navy finds out about rumours of a new Nazi weapon being built in Italy, and they send you to interfere with the Nazi plans. The campaign consists of eight missions. The maps are large, and the game follows &quot;play it how you want to play it&quot; philosophy, thus there&amp;rsquo;s no voice in your head governing you to objectives.  It&amp;rsquo;s Not All About Sniping  Sniper Elite 4 without a doubt excels at the way you scope your enemies. If you want to land some successful hits for the infamous X-RAY cam system to activate, many factors are to be considered. Gravity, muzzle&amp;rsquo;s velocity, wind speed and direction, scope drift and ammo scarcity are to name a few.  While sniping is one of the key elements, you have variety of other means to eliminate your AI Nazi enemies. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s silent take-downs with a knife, planting bombs on already cold Nazi bodies, or setting wired traps it&amp;rsquo;s all up to your ingenuity and imagination.  Sniper Elite 4 sure has stealth elements incorporated, where you can spot, stalk and silently eliminate unsuspecting soldiers, however, if you are spotted and enemies from all over start rushing to your location, good old-fashioned gun-down using SMG is also up your sleeve.  Not So Lonely  The game offers quite a few options to share the experience with a friend. You can Co-Op and run through all the single-player campaign alongside your friend, where both of you can cause havoc in whatever form you desire!  Survival Co-Op mode launches packs of enemies straight at you in the form of twelve increasingly more difficult waves. There&amp;rsquo;s much more action in this mode, but there&amp;rsquo;s still plenty freedom to experiment and improvise.  Considering multiplayer, sniper vs sniper battles are as intense as they are patient, composed and enduring. One of the signature multiplayer modes in Sniper Elite 4, requires players to land the longest distance kill shot to win.  Control multiplayer mode is basically a standard variant of capture and hold. However, having a sniper makes it fast and focused simultaneously.</g:description>

                <g:description>Homefront: The Revolution is an FPS game set in an alternate near-future timeline, where North Korean soldiers have invaded the streets of Philadelphia! The game was developed by Dambuster studios but is not the continuation to the original Homefront story.  You control Ethan Brady, a recruit to the Resistance group aiming to deplete the invaders. In an open-world setting separated by three vast regions — green, yellow and red zones, you will fight many furious battles in a guerrilla type combat. In other words, create as many diversions and short gunfights throughout the territory to split enemy forces as they are superior to you in both, quantity and fire-power. Rise to power from a simple recruit to revolutionary leader in the wide campaign that this game has to offer. Recruit other revolutionaries, establish safehouses, create and modify weapons to meet your needs in every situation and be the one in the centre of the war for Independence!</g:description>

                <g:description>This edition includes: &amp;bull; Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 Game  &amp;bull; Black Ops Pass &amp;bull; 1.100 Call of Duty Points Activisions and Treyarchs new born military shooter sequel Call of Duty: Black Ops 4, branches off into the market with a bang. The latest entry in the long-running sub-series of shooters set in an alternate and mysterious realm, this time enrolls players in a near-future setting, focusing on competitive multiplayer mode more than ever before. It is the first time throughout the series, when there is no traditional single-player campaign mode. Such change was made because Call of Duty was always meant to be a multiplayer game, with its&#039; focus being on competitiveness, continuity and replay-ability, as opposed to single experience narrative-heavy campaign. Solo experience, however, will still be present with bot companions in Zombies mode and single player challenges, through which you will be able to try out 10 Specialist characters. You will be using plenty of these in multiplayer mode so might as well know their background stories too. Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 multiplayer joins the latest craze in Battle Royale mode and brings Blackout. Blackout is a map larger than any other seen in the franchise, it&#039;s an all out immersive battle for up to 100 players, containing vehicles to control land, air and water. Standard multiplayer will contain already familiar modes such as: hardpoint, domination and objective control. In which you will be able to pick from one of the Specialist characters with various futuristic weapons and special abilities. Total control over how you customize your character to fit your preferred game-style, thrilling grounded combat experience, precise tactical decisions and character choosing to strive victorious, is now more important than ever before. And on top of that, Zombies mode is back! The newest Call of Duty&#039;s zombies arch has three unique and thrilling stories to offer immersive and action-packed experience. Mayhem and obliteration while annihilating the rotting undead, who could ask for more?</g:description>

                <title>Red Dead Redemption 2 (Xbox One) Xbox Live Key GLOBAL</title>
                <g:description>Red Dead Redemption 2 (Xbox One) is one epic tale developed by Rockstar. The game is set in Year 1899, America, where the outlaws are no more welcome and needed. Play as Arthur Morgan, exceedingly cool and well-rounded outlaw, who has been raised on the wrong side of the law since he was just a child. Prepare for a captivating 60-hours story! It&amp;rsquo;s slick, it&amp;rsquo;s cool, it&amp;rsquo;s twisted and most of all, it&amp;rsquo;s really a breath-taking experience to play through. Immerse in an immense open-world with snowy peaks, and dank swamps, lush forests and vast lakes, deep and dim caves and of course living, breathing western towns. You&amp;rsquo;ll be tempted to visit each and every corner of this game, and you&amp;rsquo;ll do it because it&amp;rsquo;s worth it. Red Dead Redemption offers extreme levels of realism, things like single-action pistols need to be cocked before firing same as coffee needs to be brewed before drinking. The attention to detail is uncanny, and all these little bits combined allows for a player to get stuck in this world without any desire to leave. Red Dead Redemption 2 is one of those games you simply must try out at least once, and when you do, you are certain to come back for more.</g:description>

                <g:description>The military FPS juggernaut is back. EA Games storms the market with their fifth addition to Battlefields&amp;rsquo; franchise. Battlefield V is set back in one of the most intense and horrific events of the past that switched the axis of power around the globe, the Second World War. Improved handling, vast customization options, all-new multiplayer experiences, a variety of unique war stories created for single-player, all new co-op content along with stunning graphics and visual effects make this action-packed shooter more immersive than it has ever been. Get lost in action: From an all-out 64-player death-match to attack and defend skirmishes, from team versus team clash to last man standing battle royal, Battlefield V multiplayer has it all. If you are a less competitive type or just want to get the feel of how hard the times were, solo-campaign offers a variety of historical close ups, where you can play for one of the protagonists fighting in unique locations, varying from steaming desserts to icy mountain passages. Then there is a Co-op mode with the opportunity for up to 4 players to form a squad, customize your characters and face never before seen challenges together. The overall feel: As expected from Battlefield series, the graphics and overall mechanics are smooth and precise. Extension to movements and character animations provide the ability to execute rolls, vault, climb, slide, glide, run while crouching, jump, fall and other essential survival movements. You can also pick from 4 different soldier class types and 5 archetypes, drive various military vehicles, fortify your defence stations as well as gain access to many more in-game content.</g:description>

                <g:description>Frostpunk is a city management survival RTS game developed by 11 bit studios! It&amp;lsquo;s the year 1886, after the erruption of a few super vulcanoes, sun dimming down and other factors that are yet unknown, a never before seen winter has come to freeze everything what&amp;lsquo;s still left of humanity.  In response to the ever-falling temperatures British authorities establish generators &amp;mdash; massive coal-driven towers that are meant to secure the survival of mankind. The game offers four scenarios in which you must make challenging and often ruthless decisions to survive the freeze.  Gather and manage resources such as metal, wood, coal and food, command your workers and engineers to build various facilities, manage political campaign and consider or ignore the demands of your people. Your every action can and most likely will cause a reaction from your inhabitants, you&amp;lsquo;ll be constantly evaluated and either judged or praised upon. Your goal is to survive and this game will do everything in its power to make you tremble and fail.</g:description>

                <title>Insurgency: Sandstorm Steam Key GLOBAL</title>
                <g:description>Welcome to the most realistic FPS to ever be released! Insurgency: Sandstorm is a New World Interactive release that pairs up amazing graphics with gameplay mechanics that have been thoroughly perfected to provide a real-life feel. Attention to Detail The amount of detail is bound to catch anyone by surprise, the sound effects are beyond amazing, even allowing you to recognize whether the shots are fired by a foe or an ally simply by the sound of the gunshot, since the two factions have access to different guns. You are nearly guaranteed to be awed during every minute of play when you first try out the game because of all the attention to detail and work that has been put in. HOW MUCH!?!? It would be reasonable to think, that a game of such quality is going to cost tons of money, however, that is not the case, not even close! The Insurgency: Sandstorm price is bound to catch you off guard, as one of the best FPS games in the market costs less than half of what AAA normally cost, which means you get a top-quality product for the price of an indie game. Dive Straight Into The Action This game does not need convincing, simply get your Insurgency: Sandstorm key and hop into the action, whether you are competing with other players in a vast multiplayer mode with teams of up to 16 players or play versus the AI, which is balanced to perfection, making you feel just as if you were competing against other players!</g:description>
